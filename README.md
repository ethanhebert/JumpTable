# JumpTable

Class Assignment. Implements Stack, Queue, and List data structures in the terminal with file i/o and user displays.

The Stack, Queue, and ArrayList classes are used. CSV files for each data structure are read in and parsed. Within the terminal, the user can add or remove elements from each data structure. The display is updated to show the user how the data structure operates, and the final changes are saved back to the original files.
